# VLCKit SAT>IP ShowCase app

This app demonstrates the use of VLCKit for iOS (dubbed _MobileVLCKit_) and tvOS (dubbed _TVVLCKit_) to discover SAT>IP servers, feed a custom channel list from a m3u file and finally play a channel of your choice. Additionally, we give an introduction to video output view manipulation with VLCKit.

## Requirements

This project uses the dynamic framework variants of VLCKit and therefore requires iOS 8 or tvOS 9. Note that bitcode is enabled only for the tvOS package. If you require a bitcode package for iOS, let us know.

Everything was tested with Xcode 7 on OS X 10.11 only.

## How to start

* Download the respective framework binary images, unpack and safely store them somewhere on your Mac.
* Open the xcodeworkspace
* Navigate to either target and fix your _Framework Search Paths_ to have them point to the correct folder on **your Mac**.
* Compile and run
